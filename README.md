# FinMate
Introducing our financial management platform that offers a comprehensive suite of tools for tracking expenses, analyzing spending patterns, exploring investment opportunities suitable for their needs, and managing peer-to-peer lending and borrowing at mutually agreed upon interest rates for students in the same community or college. This lending system was inspired by the necessity to facilitate easier transactions amongst students that would give students financial freedom and help them in their various endeavors like financing projects in college or collecting crowdfunds for their startups.<br />
Our platform also includes a savings calculator that allows users to set target amounts and time frames for achieving their financial goals. With our platform, users can easily keep track of their transactions with friends, see who has paid and who still owes money, and stay on top of their finances. Whether you're a student looking to manage your finances or someone who wants to stay on top of their financial goals, our platform is the perfect tool for you. Sign up today and take control of your finances!
